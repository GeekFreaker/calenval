I tried to use console jobs I set up a command and a job but I
wasn't really sure how to use them since Eloquent makes querying so much easier,
I think they are used in task scheduling for instance If I was to call the Enrico
API one holiday event at a time then I could schedule events over a a set time
but I found a way to call down all the events in one go.
